            PostgreSQL server). A new database with the provided name will be created. Please also note that
            MixERP database uses "template0" database, along with "C/POSIX" locale and "UTF8" encoding.

    <p>
        Please make absolutely sure that you provide a secure password here. PostgreSQL is one of
        the best modern database management systems with built-in rich security features. But
        that would not make your PostgreSQL installation secure by default. You would find various tutorials about
        securing your PostgreSQL instance on the internet. Some of which are:
