#Bonus Slab Details
After setting up [bonus slabs](bonus-slabs.md) we
can now define the commission rate for different level
of sales volume made by the sales person under the chosen bonus slab. 
Here, you can create various schemes for bonus or commission payments
 to the salesmen. Later the salesmen can be assigned into these bonus 
slabs from Bonus Slab Assignment to pay them bonuses according to the 
slab.

The menu will by default show you the list of bonus slabs that have 
been created so far. The checking frequency decides the frequency of
 posting the payable bonus/commission to the sales man's account. 
For instance, Checking Frequency Id of 'End of Month' will post the
 payable amount of commission for any given sales man to his or her 
account at the end of every month. Enter a slab wise incremental or 
flat bonus rate (in percentage) which increases as the amount 
increases.
