#State Sales Taxes

In United States and some other countries, there are several federal taxes including the state sales tax. 
A state government may have a totally different sales tax rate(s) than the other. Interestingly, the state government may
require you to apply different sales tax for the same item, depending on :

##Type of Customer

* Type of Establishment (Entity)
* Type of Industry

##Type of Item

Some items would be tax exempt in one state. But this would not necessarily be the same in another state. Similarly,
a state government may impose a higher or lower tax rate based on the type of an item.


##Combination of Customer Type and Item Type

In some states, an item may qualify for much lower tax rate when sold to a certain industry or corporation type, while remaining the 
same for all other cases.


##Remember

* It is advised that you understand the tax requirement of your state government, including your
nexus state governments. Please consult with a professional or even the state governments for more information 
about your tax requirement.
* In MixERP, you must configure state sales tax information for all states you operate in, including your nexus presence.
