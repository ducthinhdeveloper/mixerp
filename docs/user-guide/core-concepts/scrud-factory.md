#Working with ScrudFactory

ScrudFactory is one of the various core modules of MixERP which facilitates rapid application development (RAD). 
ScrudFactory provides a common and consistent user interface, which helps you efficiently get your job done.

#View Panel

The view panel consists of:

* Command Buttons
* GridView
* Selectors
* Pager

##1. Command Buttons

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Button</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Show Compact</td>
            <td>Displays the compact view and resets the page to 1.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Show All</td>
            <td>
                Displays an expanded view and resets the page to 1.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Warning</strong>: If your entity is a huge table, MixERP will only
                display 1000 rows with paging.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Add New</td>
            <td>Displays a form to add a new record.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Edit Selected</td>
            <td>Displays a form with the selected record for editing. See <strong>selectors</strong> below.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Delete Selected</td>
            <td>Deletes the selected record. See <strong>selectors</strong> below.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Print</td>
            <td>Opens up a popup window with a printer-friendly view of the current grid.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


##2. GridView
The ScrudFactory grid displays information about an entity. In this example, [chart of accounts](../sales/setup/coa.md) is displayed. MixERP Scrud grid, by default, has the following behavior:

* The rows are sorted by the key column.
* The rows are paged by the size of 10.
* The default grid page size of 10 is also known as a **compact view**.

##3. Selectors

The first column of each row is a selector with a radio button. You can click anywhere on a row to turn the selection on.
Similarly, clicking another row will toggle your selection from previous row to a new one, resulting in only one row being
**"selectable"**. Once you select the record you're interested in, you can then perform some other tasks
such as editing or deleting the entry.

<div class="ui info message">
    MixERP will keep an audit trail of the user performing the Scrud operation.
</div>


##4. Pager
The application user might not be interested to view all records at once. This would be somewhat irrelevant, confusing, and even boring.
On the other hand, displaying a huge chunk of information would also be a resource-intensive task. That is the reason
why the records are sorted and arranged in pages.


##Form View

The form view provides you a form panel to work with--presenting a collection of fields.


| Type                  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Text Field            | Allows you to enter text. |
| Number Field          | Enter a valid number, generally a positive number. |
| Radio Buttons         | Allows you to select an item from the group of radio buttons. |
| Date Field            | Enter a valid date value or select a date from date-picker control. |
| Select Field          | Allows you to select an item from the drop-down list control. |
| Selector Icon         | See item selector below. |


![ScrudFactory Form](images/scrud-form.png)

Remember that when a field is marked with a star (\*), it means that you cannot leave it empty. Similarly, some fields
may validate values to have standard and recognizable formats, including but not limited to, the following :

* whole numbers
* decimal numbers
* dates/times
* phone numbers
* zip codes
* others

As soon as you enter all required and relevant fields, you are good to go.
Click **Save** to add the new record. For whatever reason you want **not to save**
the entry, click **Cancel**. Similarly click **Reset** to reset the form fields to their original state.

<div class="ui info message">
    When you are adding a new record and then resetting, the form fields will generally fall back to
    an empty or the default value. Editing a form and then resetting, on the other hand, would reset the fields to the existing
    value(s) they were initialized with.
</div>

##Item Selector

Item selector allows you to quickly find the item you are looking for by displaying a modal window. In the modal window,
you can filter records by performing a [wildcard search operation](wildcard-search.md).

When you find the item you were looking for, click on the associated link **Select**. Clicking the link will close the
item selector window and update the associated control with the value you selected.
